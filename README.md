Tiny Campfire Ruby client so you can get on with it. It's implemented on top of
`Net::HTTP` and only requires the `multi_json` gem for Ruby compatibilities.

## <a name="installation"></a> Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'campy'
```

And then execute:

```bash
$ bundle
```

Or install it yourself as:

```
$ gem install campy
```

## <a name="usage"></a> Usage

First create a `campfire.yml` file in your home directory:

```bash
$ cat <<CAMPFIRE_YAML > $HOME/.campfire.yml
:account: mysubdomain
:token: mytoken123
:room: House of Hubot
CAMPFIRE_YAML
```

### <a name="usage-bin"></a> campy Command

Campy comes with the `campy` command so you can send messages from the
command line:

```bash
$ campy speak "Campy says yello"
$ campy paste "Long pastes are long"
$ campy play ohmy
```

Or pipe in your message:

```bash
$ echo "Campy tries to honor unix conventions" | campy speak
$ cat ~/stackdump.log | campy paste
$ echo ohmy | campy play
```

### <a name="usage-ruby"></a> Ruby Library

There's not much to the API; create a `Campy::Room` and go:

```ruby
require 'campy'

campy = Campy::Room.new(:account => "mysubdomain",
  :token => "mytoken123", :room => "House of Hubot")
campy.speak "Campy says yello"
campy.paste "Long pastes are long"
campy.play "ohmy"
```

If you know the room ID and would prefer to use that instead of the name:

```ruby
require 'campy'

campy = Campy::Room.new(:account => "mysubdomain",
  :token => "mytoken123", :room_id => "12345")
campy.speak "Campy says yello"
campy.paste "Long pastes are long"
campy.play "ohmy"
```

Why not use the `campfire.yml` config? Let's do that:

```ruby
require 'campy'
require 'yaml'

campy = Campy::Room.new(YAML.load_file(
  File.expand_path("~/.campfire.yml")))
campy.speak "Campy says yello"
campy.paste "Long pastes are long"
campy.play "ohmy"
```
